"""Shared MCP tool implementations.

This module will contain shared tool implementations that can be used by
both vgc_mcp and vgc_mcp_lite servers.

Future migration:
- stats_tools
- damage_tools (base version)
- speed_analysis_tools
- team_tools
- usage_tools
- spread_tools
- import_export_tools
- coverage_tools
- matchup_tools

These tools will be moved here from vgc_mcp/tools/ and imported by both packages.
